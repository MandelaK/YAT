Welcome to the notes app! This is a command line application that stores very simple notes as JSON.

To get started, clone and checkout to the branch `notes-basic-0.1`

From there you can run `npm install`

To start the app, simply run the command `npm notes/index.js --help`. This should give some of the supported commands by the notes app. For example, should you want to know the supported sub-commands for `add`, you would simply run the commmand `node notes/index.js add --help` from which you'll see which arguments are required and their data types.
